#what did i do :-

#1-exploring my dataset :
•Check shape, dtypes, missing values
• Understanding missingness guides imputation
• Variable types guide all visual choices

#2-Selecting Meaningful Visualizations:
Selecting Meaningful Visualizations
• numeric colunms: histplot, kdeplot, scatterplot, heatmap
• Categorical colunms:countplot, boxplot, facets

#3-Univariate and Bivariate Visuals:
• For each: skewness, outliers, group differences
• Flag variables needing transformation
• Identify potential group-level interactions

#4-Correlation :
• Understand correlation structure
• Identify predictors correlated with target
• Find clusters for potential feature reduction

#5-finally Linking Visuals to Modeling Decisions
